Moontool was originally written for the Sun Workstation under the SunView graphical user interface by John Walker in December of 1987. The program was posted to the Usenet news group comp.sources.unix in June 1988 and was subsequently widely distributed within the Sun user community. As the original posting began, “What good's a Sun without a Moon?”.
